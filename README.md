# Zenith with Typescript

This project is a successor to [zenith-test-complete](https://github.com/theGhostJW/zenith-test-complete). The underlying concepts similar to zenith-test-complete but TestComplete web UI interaction was replaced with WebdriverIO and productivity was improved with TypeScript (fully open soure tools and languages).

This is no longer an active project. Future development effort is being dedicated to [pyrethrum](https://github.com/theGhostJW/pyrethrum) which is far more ambitious framework in a fully functional language (Haskell).
